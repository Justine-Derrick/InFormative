Hi! Thanks for checking out this project. Just a few things before we start:

Step One: You will need to generate an API key for https://openweathermap.org/api and for https://gnews.io/ 
Step Two: In the keyCopy folder insert the gnews API key into the key = "", and the weathermap API into the weatherKey = ""
Step Three: in the index.html file, change the script source at the bottom of the document from ./js/key.js to ./js/keyCopy.js to ensure your keys are linked in
Step Four: View the site!
